# For a rainy dayâ€¦

These are ideas that I am putting on ice until I have an opportunity to see them to fruition. Some are big ideas, some are small ideas. My goal with this repository is to initially record a minimal description of the idea--only enough to reconstitute the idea later and pick up where I left off--but also to allow for details and developments to be added later in a way that shows how the idea progresses.

## Ideas so far:

* [Action Research in Art Education](action-research/overview.md) - What would a distributed network of professional teacher-researchers look like? What sort of impact could it have?
* [Gallery Compositions](gallery-compositions/overview.md) - How can we interact non-verbally with artwork? What happens when you give young children nose flutes and modern art?
