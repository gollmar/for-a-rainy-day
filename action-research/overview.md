# Action Research in Art Education: Overview

Context: museum, school

Audience: K-8 teachers

Big ideas: distributed research, professional networks, advanced professional development in art integration

Rather than the typical museum offering of teacher professional development workshops, this would be an extended (1- to 2-year) institute for teachers to learn art-integration strategies and then develop and implement their own action research projects in their own classrooms.

This would look very much like (or could, in fact, be) a high-quality, graduate course offered by a university education department.

## The originating idea

This idea was conceived as a form of "distributed" research in arts in education. Though individual teachers are conducting their own research projects, they form a part of a larger community of research-practitioners that are focused on the investigation of a broader research question.

## The museum's role

Apart from being the program's primary facilitator, the museum also brings expertise in inquiry-based learning in visual art. Through partnership with local graduate school faculty, the museum also brings expertise in K-8 teaching and educational research methodologies.

Concurrent with the classroom-based research and professional development program, the museum will also conduct ongoing research in continuing education for teachers as well as museum-based cross-domain integration.

## A rough timeline

This program could take a wide variety of forms, so this is just an example of a timeline that might work.

### Summer course

A unique, month-long summer course in art integration practices and classroom research methodologies.

By the end of summer, teachers develop individual research projects to be implemented over the course of the year.

### Fall and spring semesters

Teachers conduct their research and meet online and in-person to check in and receive support.

### Exhibition

Teachers present their research to each other and the public in early summer.

### Opportunities for extension

Some teachers may continue as advisors or mentors for a second year. Additionally, some research may lead to additional questions or opportunities for further study or publication.
