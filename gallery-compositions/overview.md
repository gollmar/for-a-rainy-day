# Gallery Compositions

Context: art museum
Audience: children

Much of the work of a museum educator revolves around mediating the experience of artworks through language. That is, we talk about art, read about art, and write about art. But what if we used *art* to interact with art? What would that look like?

## Goals

These aren't exactly measureable in their current form, but broadly speaking, participants willâ€¦

* engage actively with artworks through close looking,
* interact **non-verbally** but still meaningfully with artworks,
* create original music compositions consisting of gestures inspired by artworks.

## Materials

* Three or four different kinds of non-pitched, easy-to-use (and easy-to-abuse) musical instruments. These should be small, cheap items, since you will need one of each per participant. For example:
    * Plastic nose flutes
    * Jingle bells
    * Sandpaper
* Audio recorder

## Activity

Grab everyone's attention by making an intriguing musical gesture with one of the instruments. Then, introduce the gist of the activity: we will be making our own compositions based on the artwork in the gallery.

Introduce the basic techniques of the musical instruments, highlighting the variety of sounds and gestures that they can produce. The goal is not to be exhaustive in this introduction; merely provide the minimum entry point for participants to experiment on their own.

Give everyone two minutes to experiment with an instrument of their choice. Then, give them two more minutes to experiment with one or both of their other instruments.
